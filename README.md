# twitch-tidal

twitch-tidal is an experiment in live coding collaborative music.

It provides a interface to TidalCycles from twitch.tv chat, by forwarding patterns in messages over OSC. 

Patterns are passed 1:1 between twitch and Tidal, so whatever works in Tidal will (in theory) work from a twitch message.

Twitch Message | Tidal Equivalent
--- | ---
`!t "bd cp sn hh"` | `d1 $ s "bd cp sn hh"`
`!t "psr*4" # speed "<1 2 3 4>"` | `d1 $ s "psr*4" # speed "<1 2 3 4>"`
`!t silence` | `d1 $ s ""`

In practice, you can think of `!t x` as shorthand for Tidal's `d1 $ s x`.

Most SuperDirt effects work within twitch-tidal, and full a list of working effects can be found in [effects.json](https://github.com/isyuck/twitch-tidal/blob/main/effects.json). While Tidal's mini-notation works fully, no functions are yet available.

Patterns are kept on a time based stack and are associated with users. There is a (configurable, maybe one day dynamic?) maximum number of patterns that can be active at any one time. When a user sends a new pattern to the chat, their currently active (old) pattern will be replaced by their new pattern. If they don't have any active patterns, the *oldest* pattern on the stack will be replaced, regardless of who it belonged to. As new patterns replace old patterns, new groups of patterns will form over time.

twitch-tidal doesn't intend to be a twitch based [estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary), [troop](https://github.com/Qirky/Troop), or [flok](https://github.com/munshkr/flok). All of these are better alternatives for collaborative live coding. Streaming on twitch incurs a 10-30 second delay between sending a pattern and hearing it's result. With enough active users, by the time you hear your pattern it may already have been replaced by a new one from someone else. twitch-tidal aims to explore emergent music in a group context, created by users who will have to anticipate where the music will be by the time they get to hear their pattern.

### Requirements

twitch-tidal should work on all major OS's. You will need, in no particular order:

- A twitch channel to stream to
- A *seperate* account for twitch-tidal to use as a bot
- People who want to make music
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/Welcome)
- [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)

A full guide for installing Tidal and SuperCollider for various platforms can be found [here](https://tidalcycles.org/Installation).

After these are installed and working, you will need to modify your Tidal boot file, `BootTidal.hs`, to
tell Tidal to listen for OSC messages. you can find this in the `tidal` directory wherever cabal is installed , e.g.
for Tidal v1.7 on Linux: `~/.cabal/share/x86_64-linux-ghc-8.4.4/tidal-1.7/BootTidal.hs`

change the line:

`tidal <- startTidal (superdirtTarget {oLatency = 0.1, oAddress = "127.0.0.1", oPort = 57120}) (defaultConfig {cVerbose = True, cFrameTimespan = 1/20})`

to include:

`cCtrlAddr = "0.0.0.0"` and `cCtrlPort = 6060`

so it looks like this:

`tidal <- startTidal (superdirtTarget {oLatency = 0.1, oAddress = "127.0.0.1", oPort = 57120}) (defaultConfig {cVerbose = True, cFrameTimespan = 1/20, cCtrlAddr = "0.0.0.0", cCtrlPort = 6060})`

`cCtrlPort` is the port that tidal listens for OSC messages on, so if you're using this port for something else, 
or if you want it to be another number you can modify it. (if you do this, keep in mind that you'll have to also change the port from
6060 in `config.js`.

### Install 

Once you've met the requirements above, you can download twitch-tidal by opening a terminal and running:

`git clone https://github.com/isyuck/twitch-tidal.git`

Again from a terminal, enter the twitch-tidal directory by running:

`cd twitch-tidal`

After this you have to install the packages twitch-tidal uses. Do this by running:

`npm install`

---

### Config

Next, you need to configure twitch-tidal to your channel. Replace `username` and `password` in `config.js` to
the username and password/OAUTH of your bot account. Then change `channels` to the channel name of the *different* account
hosting the stream. You can also change `maxActivePatterns` if you want to have more/less patterns active at once.

### Running twitch-tidal

*Tidal related tutorials can be found on the Tidal wiki.*

Finally, you can start streaming! To get everything started:

- Run twitch-tidal from a terminal: `node twitch-tidal.js`.
- Start SuperCollider and SuperDirt.
- Open `tidal.tidal` in your editor of choice.
- Boot TidalCycles.
- Next, evaluate all the code in the `tidal.tidal` file. Now Tidal should listen to OSC messages from twitch-tidal.
- Test by sending a message like `!t "cp bd"` to the twitch chat in the channel you're streaming to.

If everything is working correctly, you should hear a clap and a kick drum.
